# Note to Users

As of April 2024, this app is banned and its store is shut down from Google Play 
due the violation of their Violent Extremism policy. This requires explanation for the current and future users of this app.

One of the features of this app is to allow users to freely navigate 
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) for their vast collection of audio 
materials using Android System [WebView](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebView). 
Then the app automatically detects information about audiobooks on their pages 
so that users can bring those to their bookshelves.

What Google alleges is that certain audio materials, arabic language ones 
specifically, on the aforementioned Internet Archive are regarded as extremism 
propaganda. And by extension, this app is promoting extremism.

Despite apparent absurdity of their reasoning, subsequent appeal yields no 
result. And the author has no intention to remove the link to Internet Archive. 
Thus from the version 2.6 onward, this app will be released as apk format 
directly from this repository until better alternative is found.

[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) is a true historian in the age of 
internet. Please consider 
[supporting them](https://archive.org/donate?origin=iawww-TopNavDonateButton) 
and take time to think about how internet giants like Google and Facebook are 
shaping, thus inevitably distorting, our perception of reality.
